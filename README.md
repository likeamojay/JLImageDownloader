# JLImageDownloader

Simple Swift Library for downlosding PNG and JPEG images from a given URL address. 
The library also caches images after they are downloaded so that if the same image needs to be displayed multiple times, it doesn't download the same image more than once. 


*Compatible with both UIKit snd SwiftUI*
